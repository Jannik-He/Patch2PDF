# Patch2PDF

This is the update to the deprecated web tool MA-Patch2PDF, now available in Flutter on all major platforms to build for yourself.

Due to me not having an Apple Developer account, I can't publish it to the App Store for now, but I'll do my best to provide precompiled binaries for Mac and Windows (WIP).


## Usage

### MA2

From MA2 you simply go to ```Patch & Fixture Schedule```, select the layers you want, and hit ```Export```.<br>
For now, it only supports XML files since they contain more data than the exported CSVs

### MA3

Due to changes in the exported XML file structure, MA3 is only supported in combination with the also available Exporter Plugin (link coming).<br>
The tables are being separated by Group fixtures.


### Adding your own logo

To add your own Logo to the selector, simply head to the settings page and upload one.<br>
That's it!

### Changing default config

To change the default config of the per-Layer-Settings simply head to the settings page and change them to your liking and hit save.<br>
That's it!


## Development

You are free to contribute to this little project by either providing suggestions or even developing yourself.<br>

Have fun with this little tool.
